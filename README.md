A full-stack junior developer specialising in the front-end.
After ten years of playing poker professionally, I wanted a new, more fulfilling challenge, and as a keen problem solver, becoming a software developer really appealed to me. 

I enjoy working on my creative side to develop dynamic, user-centric web applications while writing clean, tested and reusable code. 
As a Makers Graduate, I am keen to find my first professional role where I can use my problem-solving skills and passion for tech to continue to build products that have a positive impact on the world.

## Work Experience

**ECL The Care & Wellbeing Company** (Jul 2019 - Feb 2021)  
Community Carer

Carer for adults with learning disabilities with a range of needs. Helping them to develop their independence and provide them with life skills in line with their individual progression plan and objectives.

Through effective communication, I was able to build trust and rapport with both customers and colleagues. I was also required to resolve customer issues using a wide range of skills such as; empathy, influence and leadership.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Self-employed** - Professional poker player (Live and Online) Jan 2011 - Apr 2021

Poker was a huge passion of mine and it taught me many skills that I can apply to my new career as a software developer.
- Dedication.
- Analytical skills and logical reasoning.
- Discipline
- Being self-driven
- Resilience
- Problem-Solving
- Concentration over long periods.
- Adaptability.
- Ability to learn from mistakes.

I won many online and live tournaments n my career, most notably my first major online poker tournament win in 2014, in a MINIFTOPS Poker Series event.


## Skills

- **Quick Study** - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges during the Makers Academy course, including producing our two week final project written in MongoDb, Express, React and Node.js with no prior experience.

- **Adaptable** - Working in an environment that aims to develop the adults with learning disabilities, to become independent, confident and successful.
This job allowed me to practise my compassion, patience, understanding and creativity. I needed to adapt to each customer need and communication style as some could only communicate via sign language or through mimicking, which meant I had to learn Makaton.
Because of the range of needs, the sessions I ran would need to be thought out to engage customers and have customers communicating with their peers whilst learning and having fun.

- **Resilience** - I have shown a lot of resilience whilst self-studying as a keen poker player. I failed consistently, but I never allowed the failures to get in the way of success. I learnt from those mistakes and kept moving forward.
I have also shown resilience when I first started to teach myself to code.
I found it extremely hard at first, and almost gave up several times, but my passion and resilience are what drove me forward. As a result, I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent, confident and passionate junior developer.

- **Self motivator** - During lockdown, I had a lot of time that I wanted to use productively. I enrolled in 100 DaysOfCode challenge on twitter, to better my programming skills and increase discipline. Whilst coding for 100 days in a row, I built many projects and a portfolio, I completed FCC Web Development Curriculum and reached Kata 5 on Codewars.

- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. I do not shy away from difficult or time-consuming tasks.

## Education
