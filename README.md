I am a highly motivated, creative Full Stack Junior Developer, with a high drive to create great things and make the world a better place. 

I have completed various online coding courses and took what i learnt from them to built my portfolio of small projects over the lockdown period. I have become hugely passionate about writing code that is clean, tested,  reusable and following best coding practices. I am currently studying at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech), a developer bootcamp.

## Work Experience

**ECL The Care & Wellbeing Company** (Jul 2019 - Feb 2021)  
Community Carer

- Carer for adults with learning disabilities with a range of needs. Helping them to develop their independence and provide them with life skills in line with their individual progression plan and objectives.

In this role I cared for adults with learning disabilities and a range of needs individually and as part of a team. I helped them to develop their independence and provide them with life skills in line with their individual progression plans. Through effective communication, I was able to build trust and rapport with both customers and colleagues. I was also required to resolve customer issues using a wide range of skills such as; empathy, influence and leadership.


## Skills

- **Quick Study** - Able to take on new technologies and learn new practices rapidly and efficiently. I actively sought out challenges during the Makers Academy course, including producing our two week final project written in MongoDb, Express, React and Node.js with no prior experience.

- **Adaptable** - Working in an environment that aims to develop the adults with learning disabilities, to become independent, confident and successful.
This job allowed me to practise my compassion, patience, understanding and creativity. I needed to adapt to each customer need and communication style as some could only communicate via sign language or through mimicking, which meant I had to learn Makaton.
Because of the range of needs, the sessions I ran would need to be thought out to engage customers and have customers communicating with their peers whilst learning and having fun.

- **Resilience** - I have shown a lot of resilience whilst self-studying as a keen poker player. I failed consistently, but I never allowed the failures to get in the way of success. I learnt from those mistakes and kept moving forward.
I have also shown resilience when I first started to teach myself to code.
I found it extremely hard at first, and almost gave up several times, but my passion and resilience are what drove me forward. As a result, I have grown from an interested amateur coder into a competent, confident and passionate junior developer.

- **Self motivator** - During lockdown, I had a lot of time that I wanted to use productively. I enrolled in 100 DaysOfCode challenge on twitter, to better my programming skills and increase discipline. Whilst coding for 100 days in a row, I built many projects and a portfolio, I completed FCC Web Development Curriculum and reached Kata 5 on Codewars.

- **Enthusiastic** - I am highly motivated, and unafraid of challenge. I do not shy away from difficult or time-consuming tasks.

## Education

#### Makers Academy, Remote - May 2021 - Sep 2021, Remote
A 16-week intensive development Bootcamp, focusing on:

- Agile methodologies
- OOP, TDD, MVC and SOLID principles such as dependency injection and single responsibility principle.

Prior to joining Makers, I used the spare time i had while in lockdown to learn HTML, CSS, and javascript.
I completed many popular courses on the subjects, like FreeCodeCamps Web Design curriculum and JS algorithm and Data Structure course.

Some of the principles I learnt were Web design, BEM Methodology, Semantic Markup and DRY code.
