## Frank Mckenna

I am a highly motivated, creative Full Stack Junior Developer, with a high drive to create great things and make the world a better place. I have completed various online courses and from them built my portfolio of small projects over the lockdown period. I have become hugely passionate about writing code that is clean, tested,  reusable and following best coding practices. I am currently studying at Makers Academy, a developer bootcamp.

## Work Experience

**ECL The Care & Wellbeing Company** (Jul 2019 - Feb 2021)  
Community Carer

- Carer for adults with learning disabilities with a range of needs. Helping them to develop their independence and provide them with life skills in line with their individual progression plan and objectives.

In this role I cared for adults with learning disabilities and a range of needs individually and as part of a team. I helped them to develop their independence and provide them with life skills in line with their individual progression plans. Through effective communication, I was able to build trust and rapport with both customers and colleagues. I was also required to resolve customer issues using a wide range of skills such as; empathy, influence and leadership.


## Skills

Resilience - Being able to constantly fail and get back up with the willingness to improve and the confidence to know that I can eventually solve my problem, is a skill that I know is going to serve me well as a developer.
I did not believe i could become a successful developer when i first started coding. My confidence was low, i was constantly confused and I didnt enjoy coding most of the time. 
I knew this would change, and all i had to do was trust the process, and eventually i would become confident. This did happen. Now everyday i am improving and becoming a stronger developer with the confidence to know that i can become whatever i set my mind to.

Self motivator - During lockdown, i had a lot of time that i wanted to use productively. I enrolled in 100 DaysOfCode on twitter to better my programming skills as a challenge. Whilst coding for 100 days in a row, i built many projects and a portfolio, I completed FCC Web Development Curriculum and reached Kata 5 on Codewars.
